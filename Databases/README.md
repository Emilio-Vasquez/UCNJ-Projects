# **Database Student Projects**

Welcome to the Union College of New Jersey (UCNJ) Database Course Project Archive. This directory contains student-created projects from database-focused courses. The projects showcase students' skills in designing, building, and optimizing relational databases, as well as applying SQL and data modeling concepts in practical scenarios.

---

## **Organization**

Projects in this folder are structured as follows:

- **By Semester**  
  Subfolders are labeled with the semester (Example: `Spring2025`, `Fall2025`) to indicate when the projects were completed.

- **By Group or Individual**  
  Within each semester, projects are further organized by group or student name, depending on whether the work was completed collaboratively or individually.

- **By Project**  
  Each student or group project folder is named to reflect the database solution they developed for their assignment.

## **How to Navigate**

- Open the semester folder that interests you (Example: `Spring2025`).
- Inside, you will find folders for each student or group, clearly labeled with their names and the project title.
- Each folder will contain their database scripts, diagrams (ERD), documentation, and any supporting code.
