# **Data Science Student Projectss**

Welcome to the Union College of New Jersey (UCNJ) Data Science Course Project Archive. This directory collects student-developed data science projects, highlighting skills in data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. These projects represent hands-on applications of data science principles in realistic scenarios.

## **Organization**

Projects in this folder are structured as follows:

- **By Semester**  
  Subfolders are labeled with the semester (Example: `Spring2025`, `Fall2025`) to indicate when the projects were completed.

- **By Group or Individual**  
  Within each semester, projects are further organized by group or student name, depending on whether the work was completed collaboratively or individually.

- **By Project**  
  Each student or group project folder is named to reflect the machine learning solution they developed for their assignment.

## **How to Navigate**

- Open the semester folder that interests you (Example: `Spring2025`).
- Inside, you will find folders for each student or group, clearly labeled with their names and the project title.
- Each folder will contain their Data Science scripts, diagrams (ERD), documentation, and any supporting code.

## **Notes**

- These projects are intended for **educational demonstration only** and serve as a record of the coursework completed by UCNJ Data Science students.
- Please credit student authors if you plan to reuse or adapt their work for educational purposes.
- Some projects may include sample data, please treat any such data as fictional and for practice only.
