**Applied Technology Projects from Union College of Union County, NJ**

This repository showcases project-based learning work completed by students and faculty within Union College's Data Science, Computer Science, and Database programs. All projects are guided by real-world learning objectives, using industry tools such as Python, SQL, Flask, GitHub, and more.

## **About This Repository**

This repository is a central hub for:
- Course-based group projects
- Full-stack applications with machine learning models
- SQL and database design assignments
- Instructional templates and lab resources
- Faculty-curated student showcases

Projects reflect the experiential learning focus of our programs, designed and managed under the academic leadership of **Emilio Alexander Vasquez**

## **Repository Structure**

- **Databases/** — Includes SQL-based projects, schema designs, ER diagrams, and stored procedure practice.
- **Data-Science/** — Features full-stack data science applications, machine learning models, EDA notebooks, and LLM demos.
- **Computer-Science/** — Covers programming fundamentals, object-oriented projects, language-specific labs (e.g., Python, C#), and algorithmic thinking.

Each folder contains subdirectories for different types of projects and student work. File naming and structure follow industry best practices to encourage portfolio-ready formatting.
