# **Computer Science Student Projects**

Welcome to the Union College of New Jersey (UCNJ) Computer Science Projects archive. This folder contains student-developed projects from various courses, organized by semester and group. These projects demonstrate practical applications of programming, web development, and data science skills developed throughout the Computer Science curriculum.

## **Organization**

Projects in this folder are structured as follows:

- **By Semester**  
  Each subfolder is labeled with the semester (Example: `Spring2025`, `Fall2025`) to clearly identify when the projects were completed.

- **By Group**  
  Within each semester, projects are further organized into groups of students. Each group typically consists of 3â€“4 members working collaboratively on a specific assignment or project theme.

- **By Project**  
  Group project folders are named according to the project submitted by the group.
